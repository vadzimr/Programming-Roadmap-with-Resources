### Video Lectures:

**1. Pluralsight's Python Course by Austin Bingham and Robert Smallshire**

This Pluralsight's course is by far the best Python Course available on internet and is **a must** for beginners.

- [Python - Beyond the Basics](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/python-beyond-basics)
- [Python - Advanced](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/advanced-python)

I would highly recommend you to purchase these courses, because they are of immense worth, but if there are any issues - you can try out following links:
