# Guide to Programming:

## 1. Choose your Programming Language

![Learn how to program](Images/Learn&#32;how&#32;to&#32;code.jpg)

There are multiple programming languages available in market, but most of them don't make a good choice to start with. If you are new to programming, the ideal choice of learning a programming language should be from any of these four - **C, C++, Java or Python.** 

Here are few points (in my opinion):

1. C is simple to learn but many people consider it as an outdated language. 
2. Our next option is C++. But before learning C++, I would highly recommend you to learn C first and then jump over C++ as it gives you a better understanding of C++. However, this is not mandatory - *you can directly start with C++ too*. 
3. Java is a powerful in-demand language but it is too verbose which often makes it difficult for the beginners to cope up with. But this is the language with one of the most opportunities in the market at this moment (2019). So if you care more about the buck than comfort, this should be your choice.
4. Python is the simplest of all and easiest to learn. But it's better to learn any one of the three languages mentioned earlier, so that you are left in awe when you look at the Python's elegance.

 - [Java](1_Learn_Language/Java.md)
 - [Python](1_Learn_Language/Python.md)

> **Note:** Once you've learnt a couple of programming languages, rest all become a piece of cake and take only a few days to get hands comfortable on them. The only care which you should take is - just don't involve yourself too much in learning more number of languages that you forget to study the rest of the programming concepts.

## 2. Learn 'Data Structures' and 'Algorithms'

![Importance of Data structures](Images/Importance&#32;of&#32;DS.jpg)

Once you start feeling comfortable with your programming language, master **data structures** and **algorithms** in it. In programming, one thing which we are most concerned about is - **the data**. Data dominates. And if you've chosen the right data structures, organized things well, used appropriate algorithms; your code will orchestrate the data to create symphonies. Thus, data structures and algorithms are central to programming.

*Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.*

## 3.  Try - Competitive Programming!

![Practice is the key in programming](Images/Practicing&#32;is&#32;key&#32;in&#32;programming.jpg)

Once you are well equipped with 'Data Structures and Algorithms', you must try **Competitive Programming** atleast once. 

Competitive Programming is a stage when writing codes turns as similar as solving puzzles. Programming becomes a game, like any other. And you realize the fact that - *Knowing the rules of a game isn't enough to master it. For that you must practice it. Alot.*

## 4. Learn about 'Databases'

![Value of Database](Images/Value&#32;of&#32;Database.jpg)

After we have been a competitive programmer for a little while, it's now the time to transform ourselves to ones known as - **the developers!**

But for a smooth transformation from a competitive programmer to a developer, we will be changing our domain little by little. We do so by learning things - which are used in development and which are also not that different from our data structures. One such thing is - **The Database.**

## 5. Develop Something!

![Create to understand](Images/Create&#32;to&#32;understand.jpg)

It is indeed true that in an attempt of developing something, we  learn alot more from our experience which is impossible to learn otherwise. Whether we succeed in development or not, doesn't matter. At the end - we learn something new, everytime. There is no generalized way - which if followed - we shall be able to write error-free code. We are bound to make errors. We test them and debug them - again and again. This is what the process of development is, in a nutshell. 

All what we need to ensure during development is - the clarity of what we are developing. The clarity comes with experience, but what we are developing - depends highly on the programming language we are using.

> **Note:** While it may seem a huge list of options above, we haven't covered few of the most important development domains such as - Web Development, Machine Learning, etc. The reason is that - these domains are so huge, that they deserve their own separate mentioning!

## 6. Web Development
 ![Create a website](Images/Create&#32;a&#32;website&#32;to&#32;express.jpg)

Until now, you were in a comfort-zone because you were always able to do something at each step with the programming language you chose long back. But now it's time to leave your comfort-zone and reach a place - *where magic happens!* 

By leaving the comfort zone, I mean - you will have to learn a new set of programming languages and tools, without which we won't be able to work on web to get the desired results. For eg. we can't survive on web for a longer time without learning *Javascript.*

## 7. Data Science and Machine Learning

![Importance of Data Science](Images/Importance&#32;of&#32;Data&#32;Science.jpg)

Of course, *Data Science, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.* are the current hot topics that almost every programmer has heard near infinite number of times. This domain might be the comfort zone for Python developers, but it is suggested that even they should step out of it and learn new tools, which are extensively used in this field, such as - **R programming** or **MATLAB.**

## Step 8: Artificial Intelligence

![AI is tough!](Images/AI&#32;is&#32;tough.jpg)

Once studied the concepts of Machine Learning, now we shall handle the problem of - 'machine intelligence' in a more generalized format - in a domain called as **Artificial Intelligence.** 	Many new branches such as - *Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision, etc.* are waiting to be explored by us in this domain.
